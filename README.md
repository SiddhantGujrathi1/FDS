Name        : Assignment_1
=
In second year computer engineering class, group A student’s play cricket, 
group B students play badminton and group C students 
play football.
Write a Python program using functions to compute following: -
a) List of students who play both cricket and badminton
b) List of students who play either cricket or badminton but not both
c) Number of students who play neither cricket nor badminton
d) Number of students who play cricket and football but not badminton.
(Note- While realizing the group, duplicate entries should be avoided, 
Do not use SET built-in functions)


Name        : Assignment_2
=
Write a python program that computes the net amount of a bank account based on a transaction log from console input. 
The transaction log format is shown as following: 
D 100 W 200 (Withdrawal is not allowed if balance is going negative. Write functions for withdraw and deposit) D means deposit 
while W means withdrawal.
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program: 
D 300 
D 300
W 200 
D 100 
Then, the output should be: 500

b) To determines the frequency of occurrence of particular character in the string
c) To check whether given string is palindrome or not
d) To display index of first appearance of the substring
e) To count the occurrences of each word in a given string

a) Addition of two matrices 
B) Subtraction of two matrices 
c) Multiplication of two matrices 
d) Transpose of a matrix



Name        : Assignment_5

Write a Python program to store first year percentage of students in array. 
Write
function for sorting array of floating point numbers in ascending order using
a) Selection Sort
b) Bubble sort and display top five scores.


Name        : Assignment_7

Write a Python program to store roll numbers of student in array who attended
training program in random order. 
a) Write function for searching whether particular
student attended training program or not, using Linear search and Sentinel search.
b) Write a Python program to store roll numbers of student array who attended training
program in sorted order. Write function for searching whether particular student
attended training program or not, using Binary search



Name        : Assignment_8
=
The Department of Computer Engineering has student's club named 'Pinnacle Club'. 
Students of second, third and final year of department can be granted membership on request. 
Similarly one may cancel the membership of club.
First node is reserved for president of club and last node is reserved for secretary of club. 
Write C++ program to maintain club member�s information using singly linked list.
Store student PRN and Name. 

Write functions to:
a)Add and delete the members as well as president or even secretary.
b)Compute total number of members of club
c)Display members.
Two linked lists exists for two divisions. Concatenate two lists.



Name        : Assignment_9
=
Second year Computer Engineering class, set A of students like Vanilla Ice-cream and set B of students like butterscotch ice-cream.
Write C++ program to store two sets using linked list. compute and display-
a)	Set of students who like both vanilla and butterscotch
b)  Set of students who like either vanilla or butterscotch or not both
Number of students who like neither vanilla nor butterscotch should keep track of the records that are being updated or deleted. 
The old value of updated or deleted records should be added in the Library_Audit table.



Name        : Assignment_10
=
Implement C++ program for expression conversion as infix to postfix and its evaluation using 
stack based on given conditions:
1.  Operands and operators, both must be single characters.
2.  Input Postfix expression must be in a desired format.
3.  Only '+', '-', '*' and '/ ' operators are expected



Name        : Assignment_11
=
"A palindrome is a string of character that�s the same forward and backward. Typically,punctuation, capitalization, and spaces are ignored. 
For example, �Poor Dan is in naD rooP� is a palindrome, as can be seen by examining the characters �poor danisinad roop� and observing that 
they are the same forward and backward. One way to check for a palindrome is to reverse the characters in the string and
then compare with them.
the original-in a palindrome, the sequence will be identical. 
Write C++ program with functions-
a) To print original string followed by reversed string using stack 
b) To check whether given string is palindrome or not"



Name        : Assignment_12
=
Queues are frequently used in computer programming, and a typical example is the creation of a job queue by an 
operating system. 
If the operating system does not use priorities, then the jobs are processed in the order they enter the system. 
Write C++ program for simulating job queue. Write functions to add job and delete jobs from the queue.


Name        : Assignment_13
=
A double-ended queue (deque) is a linear list in which additions and deletions may be made at either end. 
Obtain a data representation mapping a deque into a one dimensional array.
Write C++ program to simulate deque with functions to add and delete elements from either end of the deque


Name        : Assignment_14
=
Pizza parlor accepting maximum M orders. Orders are served in first come first served basis. 
Order once placed cannot be cancelled.
Write C++ program to simulate the system using a circular queue using arrays
